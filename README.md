# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will stop using a product or service based on historical data. It is crucial for subscription-based industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking to reduce customer churn.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset (or similar)
- **Features:** Customer demographics, contract details, service usage, payment methods, etc.
- **Target:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook churn_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Scaling numerical data
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new relevant features
   - Selecting the most important features
3. **Model Training:**
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve, SHAP analysis

## 📈 Results
- The best-performing model achieves **high precision and recall** for predicting churn.
- Feature importance analysis highlights key factors influencing customer retention.
